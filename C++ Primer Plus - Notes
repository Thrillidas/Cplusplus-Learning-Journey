CHAPTER 1

1. Learning C++ What lies before you

	#Procedural language
		Emphasizes the algorithm side of programming.
		It consist of figuring out the actions a computer should
		take and then implementing through programming language.
		Some sort of recepe
		
		Computer scientist realize that code became harder to write in 
		larger projects, so they come out with the dicipline called
		"Structed programming"
			路Limit branching
			路Top down design

		Object oriented programming (OOP)
			It focus on concepts then prodecitures.
			It is related with data
			Polymorphism

		Generic programming
			Oriented to reuse code simplier
	# Object-oriented language
		路Class enhancements C++ adds to C
	#Generic programming
		路Supported by C++ Templates 

2. C origin
	The main goal for C language was to create a common language
	to comunicate through different hardware through compilers to 
	machine code
 
3. C programming philosophy
	Data & Algorithms
